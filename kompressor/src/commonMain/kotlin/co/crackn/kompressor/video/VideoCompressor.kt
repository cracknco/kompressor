 * so the encoded content is visually upright (the output has no rotation tag and
 * physical dimensions match the displayed orientation). On iOS, `AVAssetExportSession`
 * copies `preferredTransform` natively, and the custom `AVAssetWriter` path forwards
 * the source track's `preferredTransform` onto the writer input so portrait recordings
 * stay portrait.
